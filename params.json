Lag free!\r\n\r\n![remote-pair](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/motepair/motepair/master/docs/motepair.gif)\r\n\r\n### How it Works\r\nWeâ€™ve done a basic integration with  [Share.js](http://sharejs.org/) to allow concurrent editing via OT and bind some Atom events to a websocket, like opening/closing/saving files.\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\n\r\nUse the Atom package manager, which can be found in the Settings view or\r\nrun `apm install motepair` from the command line.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Using\r\nOpen the project to start collaborating via the `Motepair:connect` command\r\n(you can trigger this command via Cmd+Shift+P).\r\n\r\nPlease make sure that peers to open the same project directory. This is a very important step as we rely on the relative project path to identify the correct file.\r\n\r\n### Current Status\r\nFeatures:\r\n  - Insertion/Deletion.\r\n  - Open/Close/Switch Files.\r\n  - Save Files.\r\n  - Selection\r\n  - Remote Cursor\r\n\r\nCurrent Backlog:\r\n  - Peers Indication\r\n  - Encrypted Connection\r\n\r\n### Development\r\n* Create a branch with your feature/fix.\r\n* Add a specs\r\n* Create a PR.\r\n\r\n### Warning\r\nThe connection right now it is not encrypted if you have problems with that, please do not use it. That is part of the backlog.\r\n\r\nBe aware that this package is still in development, so it can be unstable, we are working hard to make the Remote Pair programming a better experience to all.\r\n\r\nPlease, if you see any bug, don't hesitate and open a Issue, we need your help to improve the code and fix all the bugs.\r\n\r\nCheck out the [server repository](https://github.com/motepair/motepair-server)\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n* [Leon Maia](http://github.com/leonmaia) ([@leonmaia](https://twitter.com/leonmaia))\r\n* [Luiz Filho](http://github.com/luizbafilho) ([@luizbafilho](http://twitter.com/luizbafilho))\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nGPL v3 License. &copy; 2014 Leon Maia & Luiz Filho\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
